Variables : They behave like containers to store the values we put inside. We can take out or change these values.  
Strings	  : They contain alphanumeric characters, so we can use them like texts.  
Functions (arguments, return) : We use functions to process an action. When they take arguments, functions process these arguments and return results.
if statements : Takes logical arguments to process conditional statements. 
Boolean values (true, false): They can be only true or false as value.
